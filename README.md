# Optimizing-Power-Plant-Energy-Distribution

# Overview

This project presents an optimization model aimed at minimizing electricity generation costs in Ontario while ensuring sustainability and grid reliability. The model incorporates fuel, health, operational, startup, and shutdown costs, alongside constraints like emission caps and reserve margins. The results demonstrate a 35.38% reduction in daily costs, with renewables contributing 88.3% of total power generation.
